The `application.properties` file you provided contains configuration properties for a Spring Boot application. Let's go through each property and provide a brief explanation:

1. `server.port=8080`: Specifies the port number on which the Spring Boot application will run. In this case, it is set to port 8080.

2. `spring.datasource.url`: Specifies the URL for the MySQL database connection. It includes details such as the host (`localhost`), port (`3306`), database name (`connectwindowfinal`), and additional parameters for database creation, SSL usage, and public key retrieval.

3. `spring.datasource.username` and `spring.datasource.password`: The username and password for the MySQL database connection. In this case, both are set to "root".

4. `spring.jpa.show-sql`: Determines whether to output the SQL statements executed by JPA (Java Persistence API) to the console. It is set to "true", enabling SQL logging.

5. `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto`: Controls the behavior of Hibernate's schema generation. It is set to "update", which means Hibernate will attempt to update the database schema based on the entity mappings.

6. `spring.jpa.open-in-view`: Specifies whether to automatically open and close an EntityManager in the "OpenInView" pattern. It is set to "false", disabling this behavior.

7. `server.servlet.session.persistent`: Controls whether HTTP sessions are persisted between restarts of the application. In this case, it is set to "false", meaning sessions won't be persisted.

8. `spring.mail.host`, `spring.mail.port`, `spring.mail.username`, `spring.mail.password`: Configuration properties for sending email using SMTP. These properties specify the SMTP server host, port, username, and password for the Gmail account being used.

9. `spring.mail.properties.mail.smtp.auth`: Specifies whether SMTP authentication is enabled. It is set to "true".

10. `spring.mail.properties.mail.smtp.starttls.enable`: Determines whether to enable the STARTTLS encryption protocol for the SMTP connection. It is set to "true".

These properties configure various aspects of the Spring Boot application, such as database connection, JPA behavior, session management, and email sending.
